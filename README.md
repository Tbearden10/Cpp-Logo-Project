The goal of this project was to implement a solultion to draw triangles when given a data file containing only verticies. 
The solution was found by first creating a custom triangle class, which then had 3 child classes for each type of triangle.
From here it came down to determining whether or not the verticies made up a valid triangle, if true, they were inserted into a vector to then be displayed.
The graphics were handled with SFML (Simple amd Fast Multimedia Library)
